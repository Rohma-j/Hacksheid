in week2 we buid a server,basic html form and a data file.
it helps understanding how server works and how all three of them are going to connect and work together.
the data entered in form is campared by database and decided whether it matches or not.
it follows the path from client request -> server respond by form -> user enter data -> data is recived by servar ->server respond accordingly
